## Introduction to Renderman

- When Renderman was first proposed it was a C like API for the development of scene descriptions to be rendered
- The description file produced is usually called a RIB (Renderman Interface Byte stream) file and this is then passed to the renderer
- The description of how the surface is to be textured and shaded is determined by a number of files called shaders
- These can describe surfaces, displacements, lights, volumes.
